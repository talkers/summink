			   How to use help
			   ---------------
 It is hugely recommended that you read help pages 1 though 14 for a
    quick guide on the commands available and general information.
			 (Do help 1 ... etc)

	       help index gives an index to pages 1-17

	 help <command> now gives help on individual commands

	Thanks to Batfink for the original helpfiles, Sparrow for 
          the updated ones, and Xolf for some of the others...
                (And Chris for the spell checking :)

 	      Any problems, comments or suggestions to:
                 summink@somewhere or <the admin>

        Do 'help rooms' 'help lists' and 'help basic' to get a
           basic overview of what some of the commands do.

Look around and enjoy the place. If you would like a permenant account
   then ask around for 'residency' and you'll usually find there's
		 someone around who can help you out.

			      ----------

          Here, the term 'administrators' refers to Whoosh

 In no event will the administrators of this program be liable to you
   or anybody else for any damages, including any general, special,
 incidental, or consequential damages, arising out of use or inability
   to use the program, or arising from the actions of you or other
			users of the program.
   This includes, but is by no means limited to, the fact that any
 statement made by any user of the program is not necessarily the view
	   of the administrators, nor supported by them.
	
     By using this program you are explicitly accepting the above
  terms, for this and any future uses of the program, and that you
indemnify the administrators against any damages arising in any way to
    do with your, or anybody elses, use or misuse of the program.

:14,rules
   
                                The Rules
                                ---------

                The name of the game is to enjoy yourself.

       What you do on your own is private, but, should anything you do
 be abusive or annoying to other users (this includes 'piping' or 'spamming'),
     or at all offensive, then be prepared to bear the full brunt of the
                               consequences.
  Drug related conversation is in ALL WAYS banned from public rooms
(see help drugs for more information on the rule). Smilarly, no exchange
    or discussion of 'where to get' pirated software is permitted.
 The actions of any administrator (that includes superusers) are beyond
  argument. However, please note that NO-ONE on the program has the power
      to  snoop, or intersect anything that happens in private.
    You must set a valid email address or your user will not save.
   Please stick to one resident user per person, it saves on disk
 space. Anybody found having multiple characters, may have ALL their
		        users brutally removed.

:15,credits

                             Credits
                             -------

         This program is based on the EW-too source code
              which was coded 92/93 by Simon Marsh.
      Also Chris Hughes did a lot of work on the code in 93,
                  with it running as Foothills.

  Then from December 1993 to May 1994 Athanasius did a *LOT* of work on
                      the code as Surfers.

   Also, thanks go to all the various spods who helped debug the
  program, and provide valuable suggestions as to what it should do.

:17,basic,intro,tutorial

                  WELCOME TO THIS TALKER V0.90
                  ===========================

OK, first a quick notation note: anything written <something> should
be replaced by the value of <something>, eg "trans <owner>.<roomid>"
becomes "trans nicolai.atrium" when you put in some specific values
for <owner> and <roomid>.

THIS TALKER is a place to meet people, hang out, and talk. Please respect
other people, and treat them as you would anyone you might meet
somewhere else. THIS TALKER is run by the admin(istrator)s, assisted by
superusers (SUs). They're the people to talk with if you have problems
or questions or suggestions.

Unfortunately some people use This Talker to insult and offend others.
This is about the only thing which is not allowed. Anyone doing so can
expect to be warned and if they persist, banned from using the
program. If you are the object of harassment in public, tell a
superuser or admin and the person will be subject to punishment. If
you are being severely harassed, use emergency scripting. "emergency
<reason>" will script for 60 seconds all that happens. "emergency
stop" will stop before that time. USE SPARINGLY. If you have a good
reason noone will mind. If you don't, they will. Consider the
emergency stop on a train.  You can also "ignore" a person (when
resident), and you can always leave another character's rooms.

Continued in basic2,intro2,tutorial2 and basic3, etc.

:18,basic2,intro2,tutorial2

THIS TALKER offers many communication commands. The basic one is "say", which
is heard by everyone in the room; "tell <someone>" is only heard by
'someone'. "emote" and "remote" are the corresponding action commands.
"shout" is heard by everyone on the program, but can be ignored by 
wearing "earmuffs". "tell" and "remote" can also be done to 'everyone'
or 'friends', going to everyone on the program or to those you have
named as 'friends' respectively. "echo" statements are used for
general atmosphere; they appear with a + at the start.

Residents have a title, prefix, plan and description to add to the
atmosphere. Please try and set them to something. If everyone does a
bit to add to the place, This Talker will become much more than the sum of
its parts. Your prefix appears in front of your name when you do most
things, your title appears in lists of people in rooms and so on, your
description will be seen by anyone who "examine"s you.  "examine" will
show info about someone who is online, "finger" will get a bit less
info (but including the plan, unlike "examine" on anyone)

People with permanent characters on This Talker are called residents. If
you intend to use This Talker, it is much more comfortable to be a
resident. Ask any superuser or admin for residency. You will need to
supply your email address, which will remain private and visible only
by admins unless you make it public. Note once you are resident your
name cannot currently be changed. Being resident means only you can
use the name you are resident under.

THIS TALKER is divided into rooms. You arrive by default in the main room,
the general gathering place. Hang out here to talk and just generally
promenade. Residents have rooms of their own, and they can change the
description, name, the message people see when someone goes to the
room, and so on. Some rooms are open to all, some are only for those
specifically invited. The command "bounce" will take you on a
semi-random tour of open rooms. If you know the id of a room, you can
do "trans <owner>.<roomid>" and get there if you are allowed in. Rooms
may have exits, you can see with "exits" and you can go through them
"go <exit name>". You can also "join" someone and "visit" their home
room if you are allowed to. Read "help rooms" and "help rooms-more"
for help on the room commands.

:19,basic3,intro3,tutorial3

Room descriptions, mail, and news use the editor. This is a line-based
editor which is quite easy to use. Commands to the editor are entered
on a blank line beginnging with a ".", so we have ".quit", ".top",
etc. Read "help editor" BEFORE using mail, news, or room edit.

Each resident has a list. People can be put on it, and then be flagged
as friends, as invited, as to be ignored, that a message should be
displayed when they login ("inform") and others. Lists are an
important part of This Talker. Read "help list" to find out how to
maintain your list.

Most any numerical limits on a character in the program can be changed
on request by an admin, if you can justify it.

  a more basic level, it means noone else can use your name...

		  superuser to take action against the offending

		  that happens for the next 60 seconds.
		  It is implemented by typing 'emergency'
		  To which the program replies:
You must give a reason for starting emergency scripting as an argument.
(And the reason better be good ...)

		  Then you enter a reason why you started the scripting. eg:
	Abusive behaviour from Spang

		  For the next 60 seconds, anything that anybody says will
		  be logged to a file, however, you may stop scripting
		  at any time by typing 'emergency stop'.

IF THIS COMMAND IS ABUSED, BE PREPARED TO TAKE THE CONSEQUENCES!!!!!

:dynamic

		Dynamic rooms

  OK, you all want to know about this:
Basically every previous version of This Talker has had all the rooms of
all residents loaded into memory at once. This uses rather a lot of
memory. Sooooo Burble wrote some code to load the rooms as needed, and
this has just been added. This involved major changes to large chunks
of the room code. If anyone gets any strange behaviour or bugs
associated with rooms, use bug to describe the problem as accurately
as possible, including where you were and what you did, and what
happened. Also tell any SU or admin around. If you can send us a
script of what happened, that would be nice. Email such, and lengthy
bug reports in general, to summink@somewhere

:wwkban

  Warwick University bans 'games' such as THIS TALKER from 9am to 6pm weekdays.
THAT is why you cannot login to THIS TALKER at those times, so don't complain to
us.

:copyright

  Some people have been posting material, including but not limited to
songs and poems, written by others, and claiming they wrote it.
THIS IS ILLEGAL and also morally bankrupt. Please refrain from doing
this.

  If you must post other's works, make sure you attribute them properly.
This is not the primary purpose of the news on This Talker, so original
works would be preferred.

  Exchange or discussion of 'where to get' WareZ, that is, pirated
software, is strictly forbidden. Anyone engaging in such can expect
to have their character removed and any information we have about the,
may well be passed to the police. Should the police investigate we will
cooperate. The survival of THIS TALKER comes way above your personal
wellbeing! You have been warned!

:expiry

	Character timeout/expiry.

If a character has not logged in for some time, it may be
automatically deleted by the program. So if you do not wish this to
happen, either make sure you use This Talker regularly, or ask for
no_timeout. This can be granted by an admin if there are special
circumstances that will keep you off the net for a while outside
vacations, but when you will definitely be back on This Talker in the
medium future.

The expiry feature is disabled during and around vacations so you
need not worry if you can only login during term time.

:clipper
                        Information on Clipper
                        ======================

                         *THIS IS IMPORTANT!*
 
 For those of you who don't know, Clipper is a proposal circulating in the
 US government right now whereby the government will require that all methods
 of encrypting data (including e-mail) have a 'backdoor' of sorts so that the
 government will be able to decrypt and read the data.  As you may have
 guessed, this is an infringement on your right to privacy.
 
  To sign on a petition against the Clipper proposal, send a message to:

      Clipper.petition@cpsr.org

 with the message "I oppose Clipper" (no quotes)

 You will receive a return message confirming your vote.

 For more information ftp to cpsr.org, login as ftp with your email address
 as the password and have a look at the files in /cpsr/privacy/crypto/clipper.
