By using this code you agree to all the following terms and conditions. These
terms and conditions supercede any others that may have been imposed by
previous versions of the code that were released unless otherwise stated.

i) This code is in *NO* way supported by anybody who has ever coded
it. You use it entirely at your own risk, and in doing so agree to indemnify
ALL the people who have contributed coding time against any proceedings that
may result due to the use or misuse of this code. We are *NOT* responsible!

ii) The code is provided on an 'as is' basis. It is not guaranteed to work, or
not to. This could mean it will completely screw up the machine you run it on.
Don't come crying to anyone, we're NOT responsible.

iii) Feel free to redistribute the code. BUT please include all the files, and
make clear any changes you have made to them. By preference point people to
where you got this from, so they can have an unadulterated copy, (that, or YOU
are responsible for any questions they may ask).

iv) You MUST give credit to the following people in your message of the day,
(and must always include something like a message of the day for this purpose).

       Simon Marsh - aka Burble the originator of the code
		 Neil Charley - aka Athanasius, worked on it a lot as Surfers

v) In a 'help credits' or similar you must also mention the following people:

       Christopher Hughes - aka Chris, worked on the code as Foothills a bit
		 Michael James Simms - aka Grim (he'll hate me for revealing his real
		                                 name), worked on the code as Surfers
													after Athanasius left.
       Jeremy Doran - aka Fox, also worked on the code as Surfers
		 Nicolai Plum - aka Nicolai (!), worked on the code as Surfers and
		                                 did a lot of updates to the help files

       Various Warwick Uni (wwk) spods, and everyone else who has contributed
		 in some way. (yes this is a general credit)

(basically you just need to give credit where credit is due)
You may of course credit the entire lot in your message of the day as well,
but you'll end with a rather large one *8-P.

vi) You must also comply with the LEGALISE from the 'EW-Too' source
distributed by Burble himself. Here's a copy
